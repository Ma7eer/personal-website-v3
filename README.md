# personal-website-v3

This third iteration of my personal website. Although it is the 3rd iteration, it is the first to be published. I decided to publish this site in its simplest form because I made the mistake before of trying to make my site "perfect".

This project is hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) which offers optimization tools out the box. 

For this project the plan is to update the site periodically.

Here are some features I plan to add:

- [ ] i18n

- [ ] About me page

- [ ] Projects Page

- [ ] Blog Page
